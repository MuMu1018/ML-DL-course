# ML-DL-course
I'm learning Machine Learning (ML) / Deep Learning (DL) this Summer, as well as Python.

I will use PyCharm, TensorFlow, Caffe for studying.

I'm a beginner, and I hope to be a ML engineer, and build an interest robot.

##Week 1
Theory:
1. basic theories of machine learning and some classical algorithms (Kmeans, K-nn and SVM)
2. data preprocessing methods (rescale/standardize/normalize/binarize)

Coding:
1. realize Linear/Logistic/Softmax regression using python sklearn

##Week 2
Theory:
3. theory of Neuron, basic structure and theory of MLP (about Backpropagation algorithm)

Coding:
2. realize perceptron learning algorithm, and using dataset to train and test model
