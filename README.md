# Machine Learning Courses
I'm learning Machine Learning (ML) course on bitTiger and Coursera this Summer.

Tools using: Matlab, PyCharm, TensorFlow, Caffe (Language: Python, Matlab)

I hope to become a ML engineer, and build robots help people.

## what I have learnt

Theory:
1. basic theories of machine learning
2. classical algorithms (Kmeans, K-nn and SVM)
3. Linear, Logistic, Softmax regression
4. How to solve Overfitting problem? (Reduce features; Regularization)
4. data preprocessing methods (rescale/standardize/normalize/binarize)
5. theory of Neuron
6. basic structure and theory of MLP (Backpropagation algorithm)

Coding:
1. realize Linear/Logistic/Softmax regression using python sklearn
2. realize perceptron learning algorithm, and using dataset to train and test model
